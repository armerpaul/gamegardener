## Core Class

Let's review the core of the the most versitile full caster: the druid. You don't have much choice here, however this section will highlight weaknesses to cover and powerful abilities to synergize with.

### Hit Die: d8
```rating-3
```
This is pretty much the average class hit die size. Be glad it's not a d6.

### Saving Throw Proficiencies: Wisdom, Intelligence
```rating-3
```
Getting proficiency in wisdom saves is killer, as most magical saves are wisdom. Unfortunately, intelligence saves are the least common save 😬.

### Herbalism kit
```rating-3
```
Every druid I've ever played or played with has tried to make a potion or poison at some point. While this isn't the most potent proficiency, it means you can always make a health potion or at least have a shot at mashing some magic leaves together.

### Simple weapons, (non-metal) medium armor, and shields
```rating-3
```
Getting access to shields is very clutch, as druids tend to have middling [AC](#term-AC) due to the non-metal restriction on your medium armor.
### Druidic
```rating-2
```
Pass notes to other druids. This can be a solid plot hook for your DM, but the applications are relatively niche.

### Skill Proficiencies
```rating-3
```
Honestly, the druid gets great choices for all sorts of flavors. You can take the ever critial Perception and then a Arcana / Religion if you're a more learned druid or Animal Handling / Survival if you're a more primal druid.

### Spellcasting
```rating-5
```
It's not charisma, but it means your wisdom saves and perception checks will always be good. As a "full caster", this is your main deal: you'll get access to new spell levels every odd level. Prepared spells are great-- you can swap spells out every day! If you're new, you can easily tryout spells each long rest. Veteran players use the flexibility to swap in critical utitily spells like **Locate Animals or Plants** or **Water Breathing** as needed. With ritual casting, you'll be able to cast those spells and others like **Detect Magic** or **Speak with Animals** without even expending a spell slot!

Check out this guide each time you're preparing druid spells: [TODO](#TODO)
#### Optional Class Feature: Cantrip Versatility
```rating-5
```
Allows you to swap out your build as you become more experienced. Seems nice to codify something that most DMs were fine with anyways.
### Wild Shape
```rating-4
```
Recharging on a short rest, this ability allows druids to be changing into animals all the time. With the limitation on challenge rating (CR), the best combat options are **wolves** and **apes**. Generally, Wild Shape is better used for scouting and social encounters. A **spider** could silently crawl through an enemy's castle. As a **camel** or **horse** you could *be* the escape plan for your party. There are plenty of uses for creative players.

#### Optional Class Feature: Wild Companion
```rating-5
```
> Cast Find Familiar instead of Wild Shape

Give more flexibility to a great scouting feature? Yes please! Instead of putting yourself, in any danger, you can send your familiar who can just teleport out of existence if threatened.
### Timeless Body
```rating-3
```
At this level you're going to feel like a demi-god, so this only feels fitting. I've never really
seen this come up, except in the end of Season one of NADDPod: Emily Axford's elven druid was
having moral reservations about essentially living forever.
### Beast Spells
```rating-4
```
This is fantastic. Imagine calling lightning as a bumble bee or breathing a cone of cold as a wolf. Since most druids aren't using wild shape for combat, this is somewhat limited. However it lends itself to some epic level play.
### Archdruid
```rating-5
```

Two words: infinite health.

## Origin

### Aarakocra
```rating-5
```
Flying is always great, especially at low levels. Getting out of melee range is a huge boon to your lackluster AC.
​
### Aasimar
​
### Bugbear
​
### Centaur
​
### Changeling
​
### Dhampir (UA)
```rating-4
```
​
### Dragonborn
```rating-2
```
​The damage resistance is nice, but the rest is mostly useless. The breath weapon can be a free "spell" for some melee druids. The dragonborn racial feats aren't great for a druid either, as they key off of Charisma (Dragon Fear) or only give you a middling AC improvement.
### Dwarf
```rating-4
```
​Generally great stuff for a druid: darkvision, poison resistence and combat training if you want to wander into melee. Hill Dwarves give you extra HP, and who doesn't love more HP? Mountain Dwarves gives you an extra stat bump (using Tasha's rules) ensuring your AC, HP, and casting stat can be at healthy starting values.
### Elf
Perception skill proficiency, darkvision, and a shorter sleep time? All around fantastic for any adventurer.

#### Drow
```rating-3
```
The sunlight sensitivity can be really disabling depending on your DM. The non-druid spells from Drow Magic are situational at best for a druid. Unless it's for specific theme reasons, you're better off with a Wood Elf.

#### Eladrin
```rating-5
```
While this does key off of Charisma, these nature-heavy fey have access to a short teleport every short rest. That can mean escaping to safety when you're surrounded, jumping up to a high platform, or recovering when falling. The extra effects are just bonus and flavor.

#### High Elf
```rating-5
```
Access to even 1 wizard cantrip can add so much to a character. Options include Booming Blade for a powerful melee attack, the practically limitless **Prestidigitation** or other great utility options like **Mage Hand** or **Message** that the druid doesn't get access to normally. Then on top of that you can throw in an extra language.

#### Wood Elf
```rating-4
```
The weapon training and walking speed increase is great for melee druids. It's worth pointing out that the Mask of the Wild does work while in wild shape, complementing your scouting skills.
### Feral Tiefling
​
### Firbolg
```rating-5
```
### Genasi
​
### Gith
​
### Gnome
​These little guys bring a cute, chaotic flair to the druid class.

#### Deep Gnome
```rating-4
```
The superior darkvision and advantage on steath are solid abilities. Nothing terribly special here but you can't complain with advantage on all magical saves.

#### Forest Gnome
```rating-5
```
The ability to talk to small animals is right at home with druids. The **Minor Illusion** cantrip adds a lot of non-combat utility, and advantage on all mental magic saves is jaw-droppingly good.

#### Mark of Scribing Gnome
```rating-5
```
The extra d4 for History and calligraphy checks is nice, but not why we're here. The extra spells, both from Scribe's Insight and Spells of the Mark, are incredible utility spells. You can build a network of humans and animals that share secrets or information to your allies across the land!

#### Rock Gnome
```rating-4
```
With Tasha's you can probably work with your DM to make the Artificer's Lore more druid apropriate, though the Tinker ability is a bit harder to sqare with the nature-theme. Frankly the advantage on magic saves is powerful, making any gnome a good choice.
### Goblin
​
### Goliath
​
### Grung
​
### Half-Elf

#### Original
```rating-5
```
Really a great choice for any class: +2 to one stat and +1 to two others is the most potent and flexible stat bump from any origin. Every adventurer needs darkvision, and two free skills that can fit any build.

#### Aquatic Half-Elf: Swimming Speed
```rating-1
```
If you need to swim, you can turn into a swimming animal. This is not worth two skills.

#### Drow Half-Elf: Drow Magic
```rating-1
```
Skills are more useful than these charisma based spells.
​
#### High Half-Elf: Cantrip
```rating-5
```
Access to even 1 wizard cantrip can add so much to a character. Options include Booming Blade for a powerful melee attack, the practically limitless **Prestidigitation** or other great utility options like **Mage Hand** or **Message** that the druid doesn't get access to normally.

#### Wood Half-Elf: Fleet of Foot
```rating-1
```
You're probably better off with a Variant Human taking the Mobile feat.

#### Wood Half-Elf: Mask of the Wild
```rating-3
```
On a druid, this steath skill will definitely come in handy while in wild shape. You will arguably get more use out of 2 skills since you'll be spending more time as a humanoid. 🤷‍♀️

#### Mark of Detection Half-Elf
```rating-2
```
You don't get the other benefits of normal half-elves, and you only get some situational spells.

#### Mark of Storm Half-Elf
```rating-1
```
While damage resistence is always nice to see, the spells gained from this original are all druid spells. So the main feature of this class is of no benefit to a druid.
### Half-Orc
​
#### Original
```rating-3
```
**Savage Attacks** is a nice ability for those druids who like to use their wild shape for combat. While **Relentless Endurance** is also nice for melee, though if you're back in humanoid form, you're probably retreating or casting spells.

#### Mark of Finding Half-Orc
```rating-1
```
All the Spells of the Mark are druid spells, so this doesn't do much for a druid.
### Halfling
```rating-3
```
​While Halfling luck never goes unappreciated, there's nothing particularly good for a druid from the any Halfling sub-origin. It's 3's across the board with the exception of:

#### Mark of Hospitality Halfling
```rating-4
```
The main draw of this origin is that great spell list! **Sleep** is great at low levels, as enemies have much lower HP. **Calm Emotions** shines in social encounters, something druids aren't great at normally. **Leomund’s tiny hut** is incredible for long term party travel--and you can flavor this in a lot of ways.
### Hexblood (UA)
​

### Hobgoblin
​
### Human

#### Original
```rating-1
```
Druids aren't generally multi-ability score classes, so you're better off with a Half-elf.

#### Variant
```rating-5
```
There are a few feats that can really change a druid. Melee druids are going to love **War Casters**, and caster-focused druids wouldn't mind proficiency in concentration checks through **Resilient (CON)**. Getting a feat early means all your future Ability Score Increases can max out your casting stat (Wisdom) and then increasing your HP (Constitution) or AC (Dexterity).

#### Mark of Finding Human
```rating-1
```
All the Spells of the Mark are druid spells, so this doesn't do much for a druid.

#### Mark of Handling Human
```rating-1
```
All the Spells of the Mark are druid spells, so this doesn't do much for a druid.
​
#### Mark of Making Human
```rating-3
```
These are all spells that druids normally don't get, so the flexibility is welcomed. Some of the spells (**Magic Weapon**, **Elemental Weapon**) might be wasted on you, but you could cast them on your melee allies. Since they are touch spells, you could even have a Wild Companion deliver the spell.

#### Mark of Passage Human
```rating-3
```
This is a 3 because of **Misty Step**: being able to get out of the way can be a literal life saver. The rest of the spells are nice, but ultimately, a druid is already pretty good at mobility when it matters via wild shape and their own spells.

#### Mark of Sentinel Human
```rating-5
```
A free shield once a day? We're off to a great start. Vigilant guardian allows you to take the hit for an ally, as say, a brown bear. And finally a jaw-dropping spell list: **Sheild of Faith** fixes your low AC, or slap it on the melee party member. **Warding Bond** is also great to cast right before wildshaping, so that the damage you takes away from the big bag of HP you just turned into. **Counterspell** along side the druid's **Dispell Magic** will allow you to undo *any* magic.
