## No Choice
> Hit Die: d8
Welcome to the middle of the road. Nothing to say here.

### Saving Throw Proficiencies: Wisdom, Intelligence
Getting proficiency in wisdom saves is killer, as most magical saves are wisdom.
Unfortunately, intelligence saves are the least common of any save ðŸ˜¬.

### Herbalism kit


### Simple weapons, medium armor, and shields
Druids often get compared to druids, and
### Druidic
Pass notes to other druids. This can be a solid plot hook for your DM, but the applications are
relatively niche.
## Skill Proficiencies
Honestly, the druid gets great choices for all sorts of flavors. You can take the ever critial
Perception and then a Arcana / Religion if you're a more learned druid or Animal Handling /
Survival if you're a more primal druid.

## Spellcasting
```rating-4
```
> Full Caster
>
> Casting Stat: Wisdom
>
> Prepared Spells
>
> Ritual Casting

It's not Charisma, but it means your wisdom saves and perception checks will always be good.
As a "full caster", this is your main deal: you'll get access to new spell levels every odd level.
Prepared spells are great-- you can swap spells out every day! If you're new, you can easily tryout
spells. As you learn spells, you'll know when to swap in critical utitily spells like **Locate
Animals or Plants** or **Water Breathing**. With ritual casting, you'll be able to cast those spells
and others like **Detect Magic** or **Speak with Animals** without even expending a spell slot.
### Optional Class Feature: Additional Druid Spells
> Enlarge/reduce, Revivify, Aura of vitality

> Protection from evil and good, Augury, Divination
### Optional Class Feature: Cantrip Versatility
> Swap cantrips whenever you gain a feat or ability score improvement.
Allows you to swap out your build as you become more experienced. Seems nice to codify something
that most DMs were fine with anyways.
## Wild Shape
> Shapeshift into small animals

Recharging on a short rest, Druid can be wild shaping all the time. With the limitation on
challenge rating (CR), the best combat options are **wolves** and **apes**. This has better use for
scouting and social encounters. As a **spider** you could crawl around a whole castle and spy on
everyone there. As a **camel** or **horse** you could be the escape plan for your party. There are
plenty of uses for creative players.

### Optional Class Feature: Wild Companion
> Cast Find Familiar instead of Wild Shape

This is mostly added flavor, as it allows you to summon helpful animal companions instead of being
one. There's also a subtle mechanical benefit too: risk-free scouting. Instead of putting yourself,
in any danger, you can send your familiar who can just teleport out of existence if threatened.
## Timeless Body
> Age 10x slower

At this level you're going to feel like a demi-god, so this only feels fitting. I've never really
seen this come up, except in the end of Season one of NADDPod: Emily Axford's elven druid was
having moral reservations about essentially living forever.
## Beast Spells
> Call lightning as a bear

This is fantastic
## Archdruid
> Wolf forever
